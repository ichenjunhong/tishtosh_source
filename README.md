## decompiled source from the apk of a popular video sharing app

This repo is for reading a decompile of an apk. It is for reading only, no pull requests. 
I'm not the author. Feel free to fork, comment, notate, etc. 
Just know that compiling / running is not and will not be a goal of this repo.
Please explore the code! There is a lot here, we need eyes on. 

http://www.decompileandroid.com/ cracked the .apk in question without issue.
